**Why Trust Cirugía 24 Hours**

**Total Transparency**  
All our operation prices are fixed and all-inclusive. No surprises and no final hidden costs. You will know the final price and what the treatment includes from the first moment you enter the website. If, after the in-person visit with the specialist, another type of intervention is required, or it requires an alteration in the usual process, the patient will ALWAYS be informed before the surgery of the final cost. Similarly, for surgeries with hospital admission, a medical complications insurance is included that covers possible eventualities during surgery and in the 30 days following the intervention.

**Quality Medical Team**  
We have our own portfolio of national surgeons chosen for their experience (over 15 years on average in medical practice), professionalism, and state-wide reputation.

**Top Private Clinics**  
We attend the best clinics in Lima.

**Immediate and Personalized Attention**  
We provide personalized, immediate, and quality care thanks to the work of our patient care specialists, who will handle all administrative procedures and solve all your doubts so you only worry about your health. With Cirugía 24Hours, you will not feel alone at any point in the process.

**Safety and Trust**  
At Cirugía24horas, we sign a contract for the provision of medical services with our patients, being the only ones to include medical complications insurance in surgical processes at no additional cost.

In addition, we provide a quality certificate for implanted prosthesis products and have security and information encryption certification on the web platform.

**Comfort**  
All interventions with hospital stays always include a single room with an accompanying bed. Moreover, for surgeries with hospital admission, we send a vehicle to your home to pick you up on the day of admission and take you home on the day of discharge, so you don’t have to worry about the vehicle during your stay, all at no additional cost.

At Cirugía 24Hours, you don't pay anything until you, along with your doctor, decide to carry out the surgery!  
According to the General Conditions of the Cirugia24horas procedure, to access the surgical service after the free and no-obligation consultation with the specialist, the patient must have previously paid the amount corresponding to the surgery.

This amount is stated in the Free Consultation Voucher as GUARANTEED PRICE RESERVATION issued in your favor for the intervention at the time you registered on our website to request the consultation with the specialist.

If you have a medical expense reimbursement policy, you can solve your problem with us and then take the invoice to your insurance company without any problem.
